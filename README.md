In this project, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to compare the user experience (UX) of two popular clothing apps - Zara and H&M. Both platforms offer similar core features such as fashion listings, search, live order tracking, and digital payment options. However, through evaluation based on Nielsen’s usability heuristics, several UX gaps were identified.When you visit H&M’s website, sometimes the homepage loads as a mostly blank white page with just a bit of red text (“H&M” logo or a small sale message).Fashion relies on visuals; plain text fails to attract attention where Users might think the site didn’t load properly.Similarly in ZARA’s homepage is extremely plain — mostly white with small black text and few images.It looks stylish, but users may not realize where to click or how to start shopping.ZARA uses large high-resolution videos and images.When you open ZARA’s homepage, most banners, models, and categories shown are for women’s fashion even though it sells for men and kids too.

### CREATED WEBSITE :

To address these identified shortcomings, the redesigned website prioritizes an enhanced sense of simplicity, visual clarity, and seamless navigation. The overall layout employs well-balanced spacing and appropriately scaled typography to ensure optimal readability and a refined aesthetic experience. Image dimensions are deliberately compact and systematically positioned to maintain structural harmony and prevent visual clutter, resulting in a design that feels both sophisticated and accessible. In contrast to ZARA’s homepage—which disproportionately emphasizes women’s collections—the new interface allocates equal prominence to both men’s and women’s sections, thereby fostering inclusivity and balance. Furthermore, the navigation framework has been restructured to remain transparent and easily accessible, eliminating concealed menus and enabling users to explore various sections effortlessly.


## RESULT:
The Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified.
